# Privacy Policy Draft For Ahara Portal Helper

Effective date: [add date]

Ahara Portal Helper is an unofficial browser extension for authorized Ahara portal operators. It assists with saved profiles, login workflow, BIO/IRIS device-mode selection, and issue workflow steps on `ahara.karnataka.gov.in`.

This extension is not produced by, endorsed by, or affiliated with the Government of Karnataka or the official Ahara portal.

## Information The Extension Handles

The extension may store information entered by the user, including:

- Mobile number
- Shortcut key
- User type
- RC number
- Active profile selection
- Automation state and speed/status preferences
- Local license cache and device identifier

The extension may read or update form fields and page controls on `ahara.karnataka.gov.in` only to provide the workflow assistance described in the Chrome Web Store listing.

The extension reads local device status from `http://localhost:3499/device`, including selected device mode such as BIO or IRIS and a local device identifier.

The extension contacts a license-status endpoint hosted on `script.googleusercontent.com` to validate whether the local device is allowed to use the extension.

## How Information Is Used

Information is used only to provide the extension's single purpose: assisting authorized Ahara portal operators with repeated portal login, device-mode selection, and issue workflow steps.

The extension does not sell user data.

The extension does not use user data for advertising.

The extension does not transfer user data to data brokers or advertising platforms.

## Data Storage

Profile and automation data are stored using browser extension storage. Some profile data may use Chrome sync storage, which can sync through the user's Google account if browser sync is enabled.

Local automation logs may be stored in browser local storage for troubleshooting.

## Data Sharing

The extension communicates with:

- The Ahara portal, as part of the user's normal authorized portal workflow.
- The local helper service at `http://localhost:3499/device`.
- The license-status endpoint at `script.googleusercontent.com`.

No data is shared for advertising or resale.

## Security
